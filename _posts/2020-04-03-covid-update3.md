title: RPA ED COVID Update 3
---

> *Welcome to the the RPA ED COVID updates.  
We will endeavour to filter, summarise and forward current
information.*

### DON’T USE THE CHUTE

Please don’t use the chute for COVID samples.  
This includes blood and swabs.  
Pathology will cut off all pneumatic tube sample sending if this
continues.

### COVID order CareSet

COVID has it’s own CareSet in eMR:

### PPE update

Please see 3 attachments to this email with clear guidelines on what
PPE you need for each patient. These are SLHD specific guidelines.

Please note, as per the Chief Executive, Dr Teresa Anderson:

- Staff are required to wear PPE as instructed

- Staff are not to undertake tasks requiring PPE if the PPE is not
available for use. Any such tasks are not to proceed until required
PPE is available.

- Any staff member who is concerned about their safety must raise
their concerns immediately to their manager


### Patient masks and O2 therapy

There have been some discrepancies amongst specialities in mask advice
for patients with oxygen therapy. This is the ICU and ED consensus
that we will be adhering to:

**O<sub>2</sub> therapy**

- Nasal prongs (NP), O<sub>2</sub> flow 1-4L/min, Do NOT increase
  above 4L/min
  - Place surgical mask over patient’s nose & mouth

- Hudson mask, O<sub>2</sub> flow 6 -10L/min
  - No surgical mask placement necessary

- Non-rebreathing mask, O<sub>2</sub> flow RB 8-15L/min
  - No surgical mask placement necessary

- NIV or HFNP are **NOT** used

**Change over between O<sub>2</sub> delivery devices (= NP or mask)**

- Prepare new device
- Switch off O<sub>2</sub> flow on current device
- Remove current device, place new device, ensure good fit
- Turn on O<sub>2</sub>

**Bronchodilator therapy**

- Nebulisers are **NOT** used
- Not intubated patients can use MDIs in conjunction with spacer devices
  - Ensure O<sub>2</sub> flow to NP or mask is switched off while using MDI
- MDIs in intubated patients via the ventilator circuit are **NOT** used
- Consider iv Salbutamol as an alternative

**Mechanical ventilation**

- Lung protective ventilation with Vt 4-8ml/kg IBW and peak
  inspiratory P ≤ 30cmH<sub>2</sub>0
- Titrate FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP to SaO<sub>2</sub> 88-95% or as directed by the Intensivist
  - Refer to PEEP table in ARDS guideline
- Consider prone positioning after 12-36 hours after intubation if
  FiO<sub>2</sub>/PaO<sub>2</sub> \<150mmHg with FiO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0.6

**Planned Ventilator disconnection**, e.g. for change of HME

- At least 2 staff members in full airborne PPE.
  Additional to standard droplet PPE:
  - Surgical gown, face shield, double gloves o Airborne precautions
    need to be maintained for 30min after the procedure
- Place ventilator in standby mode
- Clamp ETT
- Disconnect and re-connect circuit, ensure firm connections
- Remove clamp from ETT, re-start mechanical ventilation

### COVID intubation

Consensus statement: [Safe Airway Society principles of airway management
and tracheal intubation specific to COVID-19 adult patient group](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2020/consensus-statement-safe-airway-society-principles-airway-management-and-tracheal)


### Updated advice regarding available masks in ED and their use.

We have now been advised that the green cup masks **CAN** be used as N95
and the white ones are no longer suitable.

This is the latest advice which is contrary to previous advice and what
we have been practicing.

Please come and see the NUMs if any concerns.

### Tea room social distancing

The tutorial room has been opened up for tea breaks to help everyone
keep their social distancing of 1.5m.


### Reduced LOC presentations and intubation

Concerning patients presenting to ED with reduced LOC such as traumatic
HI, stroke, cardiac arrest or overdose

If there is no clinical or epidemiological features that are concerning
for COVID, they can be triaged to the cold resuscitation area

**Staff are recommended to wear PPE if an Aerosol Generating Procedure
is likely (ie intubation).**

Intubation can be performed in cold resuscitation and by ED or
anaesthetics (ie not the COVID intubation team).

An assessment is made based on collateral history etc to determine the
probability of COVID.
This should be discussed with resp/ID and ICU involvement prior to the
patient leaving ED and consensus gained whether the patient is

1.  COVID not suspected (community risk) OR
2.  COVID suspected

This clearly needs to be documented in the eMR and then the pathway from
ED into radiology and theatre, to ICU will reflect this initial decision

The hospital has worked hard to create capacity to allow the hospital to
be conservative in their decision making and if in doubt manage as
suspected COVID.

This will change as community risk increases and beds become scarce.


### COVID education site

https://education-support.sswahs.nsw.gov.au/moodle/login/index.php

This site aims to consolidate all the education across the SLHD onto one
site for all to access at home or at work.
